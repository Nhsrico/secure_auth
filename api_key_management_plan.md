# API Key Management System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a complete API key management system with secure generation, management interface, authentication middleware, and comprehensive security features.

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Create ApiKey database migration with encrypted storage
- [ ] Build ApiKey schema with associations and validations
- [ ] Create ApiKeys context with secure CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement secure key generation and encryption utilities
- [ ] Add key expiration, scope management, and usage tracking
- [ ] Build API authentication plug for request validation
- [ ] Create API-specific router pipeline and routes
- [ ] Implement API key dashboard LiveView
- [ ] Create key management forms and UI components
- [ ] Add usage statistics and monitoring displays
- [ ] Build RESTful JSON API endpoints for external access
- [ ] Integrate per-key rate limiting with existing RateLimiter
- [ ] Add comprehensive audit logging and security features
- [ ] Test complete API key system functionality

## Core Features
### Security
- Cryptographically secure 64-character API key generation
- Encrypted storage of sensitive key data
- Multiple permission scopes (read, write, admin)
- IP address whitelisting and restrictions
- Automatic key expiration with configurable TTL
- Rate limiting per individual API key

### Management Interface
- Professional LiveView dashboard for key management
- Real-time key creation, viewing, and revocation
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for generated keys
- Usage analytics with request counts and timestamps
- Last-used tracking with IP address logging

### API Integration
- RESTful JSON API endpoints for programmatic access
- Comprehensive API authentication middleware
- Request logging and audit trail
- Integration with existing authentication system

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Real-time usage statistics per key
- Request volume tracking and analytics
- Security event logging and alerts
- Admin dashboard integration for monitoring

## Technical Architecture
- **Database**: Encrypted API key storage with metadata
- **Context**: ApiKeys context for all business logic
- **Middleware**: API authentication plugs and pipelines
- **UI**: LiveView components with real-time updates
- **Security**: Integration with existing rate limiter and audit systems

## Expected Outcome
Enterprise-grade API key management system providing secure programmatic access control with comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities.
